Our team is called PrimeTech and the project our group has chosen is called the Employment Portal, 
this is a Non-Profit Organization.  
This project aims to create an online and mobile platform for a NPO that will assist unemployed 
individuals in creating professional CVs and making them available to potential employers. The 
primary goal is to bridge the gap between job seekers who require assistance in entering the labour 
market and employers seeking qualified candidates. By guiding users through an interactive CV 
creation process and storing their information in a structured database, the platform aims to provide 
the unemployed with the tools and visibility they currently lack. 
Employers can view a high-level overview of candidate profiles, organized by skills, experience, and 
location, allowing for a more efficient search without jeopardizing the privacy of job seekers. With 
the candidate's permission, more detailed information can be shared for a nominal fee, which sends 
an alert to the NPO, ensuring that job seekers are notified of employer interest. 
In many communities, the unemployed frequently struggle to gain access to the job market, not only 
due to a lack of skills, but also due to a lack of support in presenting their skills and experience 
professionally. Many job seekers lack resources and knowledge for creating effective CVs, as well as 
the ability to showcase their experience in a way that appeals to potential employers. Furthermore, 
the lack of an organized, accessible database makes it difficult for employers to find and contact 
qualified candidates. 
Without a platform to assist with CV creation and provide structured visibility, job seekers miss out 
on valuable opportunities to present themselves to employers. This lack of access contributes to the 
unemployment cycle by preventing many potentially skilled individuals from entering the labour 
force. As a result, this project addresses the underlying causes of unemployment by providing 
necessary assistance in a centralized, accessible, and secure solution that connects job seekers with 
potential employers while safeguarding personal information. 
This solution will serve as a vital bridge, increasing individuals' employability and making the 
recruitment process more inclusive for employers.
